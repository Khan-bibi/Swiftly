# Swiftly

Swiftly is a real-time freelancing platform designed to solve the problems faced by freelancers in Pakistan. Unlike traditional platforms (Fiverr, Upwork) that rely on long bidding cycles, Swiftly instantly connects clients and freelancers using a real-time matching and negotiation model inspired by InDrive and Bykea.

The platform focuses on:

Instant client–freelancer matching

AI-based recommendations to highlight beginner freelancers

Local payment integration (JazzCash, Easypaisa)

Fair visibility and equal opportunity for newcomers

Real-time negotiation and communication

Separate mobile app (React Native) for users and web admin panel

Swiftly supports the mission of SDG 8: Decent Work & Economic Growth by helping Pakistani youth access fair digital earning opportunities.**
